# Project #1. Radiation-Therapy:
# Mapping Out Optimal Intensities to Target Cancerous Brain Lesions

● Simulated radiotherapy treatment using MATLAB to graphically delineate the malignant region from normal tissue
● Constructed the objective function by computing the total ionization exposure for healthy cells and the spinal cord
● Imposed constraints to ensure a lethal dosage of above 7 units is delivered by perpendicular beamlets to the tumor
