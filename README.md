# Project #1: Cardiovascular Health
# Prototyping an Ultrasonic Sensor to Detect for Myocardial Infarctions

● Conducted machine analysis of electrocardiogram waveforms to assess inconsistencies in cardiopulmonary activity                  
● Sampled a 12x12 array of piezoelectric transducers with high beam ultrasound waves to enable doppler frequency                 
● Proposed a thin, wearable elastomer as an inert biomaterial for the embedded microelectromechanical system
